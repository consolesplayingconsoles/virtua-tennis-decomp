"""protocheck.py: a call that passes fewer arguments than its callee takes. Run in the repo. Stdlib only.

    python3 tools/8-build/protocheck.py          every file's direct calls against the callee's definition in src/*.c, the stack words
                                                 and the argument registers; exit 1 when one is short
    python3 tools/8-build/protocheck.py --lost   the calls among those that leave out an integer register the original sets before
                                                 the same call (reads 1ST_READ.BIN); exit 1 when there is one
    python3 tools/8-build/protocheck.py --reads  every definition against the registers the original reads (gen_core.entry_reads); exit 1 when it declares fewer

The SH-4 passes the first four integer arguments in r4-r7, the first eight float arguments in fr4-fr11, a structure by value always on the
stack, and the rest as one stack word each. A file that prototypes a callee with fewer of those than its definition takes and calls it
directly leaves the callee reading whatever the stack holds: Virtua Tennis drew every panel at an unset position (selPanelDraw called
without its position vector; the HUD, the score and the ball shadow did the same). The proof does not see it when the callee's definition
declares the words and the caller's prototype does not: the call is compared only up to the caller's own prototype, and the cases hold
zeros in the words.

The registers are compared the same way: a file that prototypes `int f(void);` for the definition `int f(int a4)` and calls `f()`
leaves the callee reading a leftover r4. The prototype was right when the file was generated and the callee's arity was found out
later (a read in a delay slot, a pass-through whose target became known); the callee and the new callers were written with the
argument, the old callers kept theirs, and their proofs still passed: a call is compared on the arguments the caller's own prototype
names (Virtua Tennis uniformPreviewFree called nlObjPutFreeTextureOnce() with no model and Exhibition went black on the console after
the court was picked; charaTexReloadAll and strmBgmFadeOut the same; Zombie Revenge drew every item marker with no size). A callee with
no definition in src/ (it stays the original's code) is compared against the file that prototypes the most: files that disagree on it
cannot all be right. A prototype with empty parentheses says nothing and is left alone.

The register list is long and most of it is harmless: a definition names every register it hands on, so a callee that passes r4-r7
to a function of unknown arity declares four, and a caller that never had them to give is right to pass none. --lost keeps the calls
where the original gives the answer: in the caller's own code, the register is written between the call before and this one, at every
call of that callee, and the callee's C uses the parameter. Those are the calls that lost an argument (the three of Virtua Tennis
above among them). Integer registers only: the float registers are the compiler's working registers too, written before a call for
other reasons. tools/consistency.py lists the calling functions as `short call` and --fix drops the generated ones, so the generator
writes them again.

--reads is the other half: a definition that declares fewer registers than the original reads before writing them. The generator names
a register as a parameter only when the function uses it, so one that is only passed on to a callee (cpuDblThinkAll hands r6 and r7 to
cpuDblThink, which reads them) is left out, and the proof then compares the pass-through against a leftover (Virtua Tennis cpuDblThinkAll,
cpuDblPoachCheck, matchExec, playerStartReactions: DIFFERS on cases that gave r4-r7 and fr4-fr7 to a function declared without them). The
check lists the definition, the registers the original reads that its parameters do not cover, and the parameters it declares. Calls through a cast (`((int (*)(Stk3))(f))(...)`) and `extern f();` declarations are not looked at. A variadic
definition (`...`) is left alone.
