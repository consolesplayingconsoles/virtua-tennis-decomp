# Virtua Tennis decomp. Every target runs the repo's own scripts; see README.md.
#
#   make setup GDI="your disc.gdi"   read your disc and split the executable (once)
#   make                             rebuild 1ST_READ.BIN from asm/ and check it matches the original
#   make c                           build the executable from the C on the movable split (build/mbuild/game.bin)
#   make disc GDI="your disc.gdi"    the game built the way status.txt's MODE says, in a copy of your disc (build/disc-cbuild/):
#                                      MODE: equivalent (or no MODE line)  make c, and its executable on the disc
#                                      MODE: matching                      make (and the overlays), which must match, on the disc
#   make progress                    where the decomp stands
